breton: You mean that living proof that nobody listens to what I have to say? I'm trying to ignore it.

nord: Look how dumb that daedra costume is! How can it not bring a smile?

breton: Yes, let us make fun of a Khajiit desperate enough to get paid for pretending to be a daedra. I bet it will be even funnier once he tells us how much he earns.

nord: Bah! Why can't you ever just enjoy the moment?

khajiit: Um...

nord: Kahjiit, sit down with us! We don't bite.
nord: At least I don't bite, can't really vouch for Mr. Killjoy here.
nord: Or certain other... individuals.

khajiit: You know what, on second thought you two seem busy. I'll just leave you to your game.

nord: But we are bored out of our minds!

breton: On that I must agree with the old geezer. He's not much of an opponent. You can't be much worse.

khajiit: You know, I really don't think that playing cards with randomly met clutits is the smartest thing one can do.

nord: Ha! You know Khajiit, I'm so old that I was in the cult before it even existed!

khajiit: How exactly does one join a cult that does not yet exist?

nord: Boss pulled me out of the gutter when I was a wee lad. Asked me to be his bodyguard. I stuck around ever since.

khajiit: And what does that have to do with the cult?

breton: He identifies the cult with its leader, so by following the cult's leader before the said cult existed he sees himself as a member of a non-existing cult.

khajiit: I won't even pretend I understood that.

breton: That's not true! I was trying to solve World Hunger!

khajiit: With necromancy?

breton: Yes! I mean no!

breton: It's complicated!

breton: Look, I was developing a spell to instantly re-grow crops after harvest. Sure, it had some necromancy elements in it, but it was meant to be cast on plants!

khajiit: And that was enough to get you on the guild's kill list?

breton: No, at least not directly. I tested the spell on a wheat field. How was I supposed to know that there was an ancient burial site underground?

khajiit: What exactly happened?

nord: Like I said, you win with me - you get the mead.

nord: And if you manage to whip that whiny mage's ass? I'll make sure you get out of this cave alive and in one piece, old man's promise.

@option hidden mead: Is there something special about that mead? 

khajiit: What's so unusual in that bottle of mead that you have to be careful with it?

breton: There's nothing unusual about it. It's just the maid gets very angry when she finds someone caring around any kind of alcohol.

breton: And if there's anything you have to know about this place, it's to never anger the maid.

nord: Ha! Ever wondered why she's so obsessed over keeping this place booze-free?

breton: Actually, no. There is some kind of story behind that?

nord: Can't tell you, promised I won't tell anyone from the cult.

breton: Then why bring it up? To irritate me?

khajiit: You know... I'm not from the cult.

nord: See, the Khajiit is smart, not like a certain overeducated junior magic user.

nord: I can't tell you, but I can obviously tell the Khajiit.

breton: I won't even bother commenting on that. Please continue.

nord: So it was somewhere around the very first years of the cult's operation. Boss took me out for a 'lil quest. We were to find a fire atronach and drag it back to HQ .

breton: Drag it back? You mean like in a soul gem?

nord: I'm bound by a promise that forbids me to answer that.

breton: Oh for the love of... Khajiit would you mind?

khajiit: What he said.

nord: No, it was something different. I don't know what Boss did but the damn thing just followed us all the way back.

breton: On its own?

nord: Yep. Didn't look particularly happy about it, but it did.

breton: That's... highly unusual.

nord: But, that's not the important part.

nord: The important part happened literally a few minutes after departing when Boss tripped over a completely smashed Argonian lying on the city street.

nord: He casually leaned over and asked: "You seem to be an Argonian, and I read that Argonians make marvelous maids. Would you like to work for me?".

nord: I thought it was a joke, but the Argoninan mumbled a barely intelligible "yes" and Boss turned over to me and said "we're taking her with us".

breton: Wait, that drunk Argonian was the Maid?!

nord: Boss ordered to lock her up as far away from booze as possible and we left to continue our little quest.

nord: From what I've been told the next days were... brutal. She managed to make actual dents in the cell bars.

khajiit: I don't think I want that mead...

breton: So she was forced to work for the cult?

nord: No, actually that's the part I don't really get. When we returned she was sitting in her cell all sobered up and surprisingly calm. Boss took her outside and asked if she had changed her mind.

nord: And for some reason she just said "no".

breton: Interesting... and the fire atronach?

nord: Who knows. Never seen it again.

@prompt

breton: Which card would you want to hear about?

@option altmer: [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards

breton: [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards allow you to play or move more cards during your turn and are required to win the game. In order to stay on the table they have to consume resources. Each [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] card consumes one gold and one meat each turn. If there are not enough resources for an [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] card, that card is returned to your hand.

@option mer: [color=card-dunmer]Dunmer[/color] and [color=card-bosmer]Bosmer[/color] cards
    
breton: [color=card-dunmer]Dunmer[/color] and [color=card-bosmer]Bosmer[/color] cards limit the amount of [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards you can have assigned to each resource. [color=card-dunmer]Dunmer[/color] cards correspond to gold and [color=card-bosmer]Bosmer[/color] to meat.

breton: The limits are set in the following way: 0 cards = 1 Argonian; 1 card = 2 Argonians; 2 cards = 4 Argonians; 3 cards = 8 Argonians

@option argonian: [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards

breton:  [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards produce meat and gold when assigned to the given resource. The amount of [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards assigned to each resource is limited by the amount of [color=card-dunmer]Dunmer[/color] and [color=card-bosmer]Bosmer[/color] cards you have in play.

breton: [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards assigned to gold production have to consume meat to stay in play, one meat per card. If there is not enough meat, cards that were unable to consume meat are returned to your hand.

breton: [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards can also be moved between resources during your interaction phase.

@option khajiit: [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] cards

breton: [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] cards can be assigned to enemy resources in order to consume them. One [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] card consumes one resource. If there are not enough resources for the cards to consume, the resource value stays at zero and the [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] cards remain in play.

breton: [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] cards played by you can be moved between opponent resources during your interaction phase.

@option back: (Back)

%pop

@dialog card-game-rules-phases

@prompt

breton: Which phases do you want to hear about?

@option production: Production phase

breton: During the production phase gold and meat is created based on the number of [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards assigned to each resource. One card produces one resource.

@option consumption: Consumption phase

breton: The consumption phase is divided into three sub-stages: [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] consumption, [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] consumption and [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] consumption.
    
breton: First each resource pool is decreased by the amount of enemy [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] cards assigned to it. If there are more [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] cards then of the given resource the resource value is set to zero and the cards remain in play.

breton: After that one gold and one meat is taken for each [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] card you have on your table. In case there are not enough resources, [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards that did not consume the required meat and gold are returned to your hand.

breton: Finally [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards assigned to gold production consume one meat per card. If there is not enough meat, [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] that were unable to consume it are returned to your hand.

breton: It is very important to remember that [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards consume resources before [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards as that rule very often decides the outcome of the game.

@option interaction: Interaction phase

breton: During the interaction phase you can play and move cards.

breton: You can play any card from your hand to your side of the table if the current card limit allows for it. [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] cards are an exception as you play them on your opponent's resources.

breton: As for moving cards, you can move [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] and [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] cards between resources. You can only move cards that you have played.

breton: During your interaction phase you can always play one card and move one card. Additionally, If you have [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards on table during the start of your interaction phase you can also play or move an amount of cards equal to the number of [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards plus one.

breton: Let's say you have zero [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards. Available combinations are (p - play, m - move): p, m, pm, mp. With one [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] card that changes to: p, m, pm, mp, mm, pp. With two [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards to: p, m, pm, mp, mm, pp, mmm, ppp.

breton: If you have three [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards you won the game, so no point in discussing that.

breton: One more important rule is the first interaction phase of the player that starts second. In his first move he is allowed to play two cards instead of one. One could say that the second player starts with a virtual altmer that immediately leaves the game.

breton: What do you want to know?

@option resources: Resources

khajiit: Tell me about resources.

breton: There are two resources in this game: meat and gold. The maximum amount of each resource you can gather is 20. Resources are used to provide for [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards in play and to feed [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards assigned to gold production.

breton: You can control your opponent's resource production by assigning  [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] cards to enemy resources. One  [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] card consumes one resource per turn.

@option cards: Card types

khajiit: Tell me about the type of cards in this game.

breton: There are five types of cards: [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color], [color=card-dunmer]Dunmer[/color], [color=card-bosmer]Bosmer[/color], [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] and [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color].

%push card-game-rules-cards

@option hand: The hand

khajiit: What cards do I have in my hand and when do I get them?

breton: At the start of the game you draw 8 [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] cards, 3 [color=card-khajiit]Khajiit[/color] cards, 3 [color=card-dunmer]Dunmer[/color] cards, 3 [color=card-bosmer]Bosmer[/color] and 3 [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards. You don't get any more cards throughout the game but [color=card-argonian]Argonian[/color] and [color=card-altmer]Altmer[/color] cards can return from the table to your hand under certain circumstances.

@option flow: Game flow

khajiit: Remind me, what's the flow of this game?

%push card-game-rules-phases

@option goal: Goal of the game

khajiit: What exactly did I have to do to win?
