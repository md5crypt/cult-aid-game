khajiit: Oh, hello. I'm just a completely unimportant Khajiit that'll immediately leave you alone.

bosmer: Fool! Still trying your trickery on the Investigator? I see the wings! I see the horns!
bosmer: You're not a Khajiit! You're a Daedra!

khajiit: *visible confusion*

bosmer: Surprised? The Investigator sees everything!

khajiit: You've got me there, I was not expecting that.

bosmer: Ha! No Daedra will pass unnoticed by the Investigatorâ€™s eyes!

khajiit: Ah yes, everything.
khajiit: Any progress?

bosmer: To understand the Investigators work one must first accept that all is connected, nothing happens by accident and everything follows the Plan.
bosmer: Each day brings the Investigator closer and closer to understanding the patterns that govern the Plan.

khajiit: And what exactly does the Investigator want to achieve by investigating this plan?

bosmer: For eighty-seven years four months and twenty-two days.

@option hidden notes: Those numbers in your notes? What do they mean?

khajiit: I um... analysed The Board of Unraveled Connections and found myself unable to interpret the numbers I found there.

bosmer: The numbers are keys, keys to knowledge! Knowledge The Lady of Darkness will not willingly allow to leave her Forcursed Domain!
bosmer: The Investigator dares not to anger The Lady. The Lady benevolently grants The Investigator access to her knowledge. The Lady is kind to The Investigator.
bosmer: Of course even for a moment The Investigator does not forget what a foul beast The Lady is!

khajiit: Of course.
khajiit: Anyway, could you elaborate in what way the numbers are "keys"?

bosmer: They allow The Investigator to return to knowledge he has previously found.
bosmer: In the old days The Investigator was allowed to request copies but after The Accident he was forever denied access to the Copy Machine.

bosmer: A fellow investigator?

khajiit: Yes, exactly that. Will you share information with a cross-realm colleague?

bosmer: The chef working in the canteen is only a persona created to hide who he truly is. Deep under his kitchen lay secret chambers in which he practices his foul craft of breeding Daedra.
bosmer: The Investigator has seen this with his own eyes!

khajiit: Um... look, not that I don't believe you... but you know that's not how Daedra err.. work, right? I mean they... that is we don't even have a gender to begin with.

khajiit: How do you know she is a vampire?

bosmer: The Investigator does not understand how there could be any doubt? Her fangs are for all to see!
