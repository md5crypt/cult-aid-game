	zombie: Which character do you want to see?

@option maid: The Maid

	khajiit: Is there any chance you could help me get out of here?
	
	maid: No.

	khajiit: Why is that?

	maid smoke1: Oh, it's quite simple.
	maid smoke2: Watching little khajiit struggle for his life gives me this wonderful feeling of catharsis.

@option hobo: The Hobo (a.k.a. nekro)

	khajiit: And where exactly does your dry throat comes into play?

	hobo lecture: Such attitude will be a problem. To begin your journey you must open your mind and accept the unacceptable

	khajiit: And bring you booze.

	hobo flask: Yes, that too.

@option librarian: The Librarian

	khajiit: I can't say I've been to many libraries in my life but this one seems... a bit excessive as for a cultist cave.
	
	librarian actually: Oh, actually this library has nothing to do with the cult.

@option thief: The Thief

	thief hungry: Look at me now *sob* trapped, alone, without anything to eat, sitting on the ground, waiting for the end.

	khajiit: I'm here for size reference.

@option technician: The Technician

	technician explaining: Ha, typical uneducated non-technical bystander. I'm actively monitory system health after recovering from a fatal malfunction.

	khajiit: And how long will that take?

	technician explaining: As long as they keep paying me per hour.

@option bosmer: The Investigator (a.k.a. bosmer)

	bosmer: You! Who are you! Why are you disguising yourself? You can't fool the investigator! The investigator can see right through your lies!

	khajiit: Right, sorry for disturbing you sir. I'm just a completely unimportant khajiit that'll immediately leave you alone.

	bosmer: Fool! Still trying your trickery on the investigator? I see the wings! I see the horns!
	bosmer: You're not a Khajiit! You're a Daedra!

@option altmer: The Archeologist

	archeologist lecture: ...and this would further influence any surface artist of the Era. Do you have any questions?

	khajiit: No. That was a very... comprehensive explanation. I doubt you have left any details out.

	archeologist lecture: Well, actually..

@option spirit: The Spirit

	spirit angry: What the f**k is this? Who the f**k are you?

	khajiit: Um... hello?

	spirit angry: Hello my ass! Was murdering me was not enough? Does dragging my soul from oblivion give you some sick sens of satisfaction?

	khajiit: Actually I was hopping you could help me escape this place?

	spirit angry: You know what? F**k you, I'm not even going to listen to your necromancer bullshit.

	khajiit: Wait! I really need your help!

	khajiit: Please! I err... command thy!

	khajiit: Aaaaand his gone. I'm really bad at this, aren't I?

@option chef: The Chef

	chef pinch: All those subtle flavors of traditional khajiit cousin are lost in their smooth-tongued mouths as they fall off chairs and drool like little children.

	khajiit: Ah, I see... and adding less moonsugar would be...

	chef pinch: Heresy!

@option cards: Card playing cultists

	nord andthen: Boss pulled me out of the gutter when I was a wee lad. Paid me to be his bodyguard during his travels. I stuck around ever since.

	khajiit: And what does that have to do with the cult?

	breton wellwell: He identifies the cult with its leader, so by following the cult's leader before the said cult existed he sees himself as a member of a non-existing cult.

	khajiit: I won't even pretend I understood that.
