librarian: Of sorts.

khajiit: I can't say I've been to many libraries in my life but this one seems... a bit excessive as for a cultist cave.

librarian: Oh, this library has nothing to do with the cult.

khajiit: Then why would it be in a cultist cave?

librarian: It's not a "cultist cave". It might be currently used by the cult but it's my property.

khajiit: I'm sorry, your property?

librarian: Yes, I am the rightful owner of this cave complex.

khajiit: I am so fed up with this cave. Who are you?
