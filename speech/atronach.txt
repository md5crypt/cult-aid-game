khajiit: So I assume you never heard about conjuration scams?

atronach: WHY DID HE SEND YOU?

khajiit: Send me? Who are you referring to?

atronach: THE KHAJIIT THAT TRAPPED ME HERE.

khajiit: A Khajiit? You mean the chef? Scar over right eye? Severe moonsugar obsession?

atronach: YES

khajiit: Let me rephrase that to see if I understood correctly.
khajiit: You've spent a lifetime striving for a better tomorrow only to find yourself in an even worse position than before? For reasons you can't be really blamed for?

atronach: I MAY NEVER LEAVE OBLIVION AGAIN

khajiit: So you prefer to be used by mortals to heat some pipes for the rest of eternity?

atronach: THE SPELL IS BOUND TO THE KHAJIIT. WHEN HE DIES I WILL BE FREE.

khajiit: I guess that does make some sense... it's not like you have to be bothered with the concept of time slowly sapping your life away.
khajiit: No, wait, it doesn't. How exactly will you know that the Khajiit died?

atronach: CORRECT

khajiit: You know that all of this sounds like complete bullshit?

atronach: PLEASE ELABORATE

khajiit: So you are trapped in an imprisonment that you can not see and you have no way to verify if the imprisonment itself even exists?

atronach: CORRECT

khajiit: Then how can you be so sure that this "binding circle" even existed in the first place? What if the only thing holding you here is your own fear of being banished?
khajiit: The way things are you won't even know when this "spell" expires. You can end up being trapped here forever.
